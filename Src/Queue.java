/**
 * This Class implements the state and behaviour of Queue infrastructure. It inherits from DDLinkedList class. Likewise, it is now implemented as a Generic Class. Notice that this class inherits the "toString" method of DDLinkedList, which is exactly what Queue needs - no need to override it here!
